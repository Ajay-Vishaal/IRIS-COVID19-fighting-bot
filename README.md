# IRIS-COVID19-fighting-bot
A voice and smartphone controlled robot to fight the covid-19 pandemic.

Now the world is in  a great pandemic.And I found that Doctors are getting affected by the corona virus while treating and taking care of the patients. So to save the life of the doctors as well as to reduce the disease spread I've come up wiyh an idea of making IRIS-covid19 fighting bot.

USE CASES OF BOT:

CASE 1:
    We can use this bot in hospitals to collect samples from the patients who are coming to the hospitals for covid 19 checkup. Employing this kind of robots will lower the risk of disease spread,also the bot has inbuilt non contact IR temperature sensor for temperature scanning.
    
CASE 2:
    We can use this bot in hospitals to monitor patients, since the bot has builin camera,it is easier for the doctors to monitor the patients.Since it is voice and smartphone controlled it is easier for the Doctors to control the bot.
    
CASE 3:
   We can use this bot to serve as an assistant for the patients. Since the bot has builtin automation system, patients don't need to rely on another person to turn the light or fan on and off. The patient can use the bot's home automation system to control the appliances.
   
 By employing these kinds of robots we can reduce the spread of covid-19 disease to a great extent. Let's create a Corona free world!
 
 Thank you!
